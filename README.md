# PokerChecker

PokerChecker ("Poker GTO Trainer") is a web application designed to help you master equity-based calling decisions in No-Limit Hold'em poker using Game Theory Optimal (GTO) principles.

## What is PokerChecker?

PokerChecker is an interactive trainer that presents you with realistic poker scenarios and challenges you to make mathematically correct call/fold decisions based on your hand equity and pot odds. The app provides instant feedback and explanations, helping you develop an intuitive sense for GTO play.

## Key Features

- **Practice Mode:** Train your decision-making skills with randomly generated poker hands across all streets (preflop, flop, turn, river) and different player counts. Get immediate feedback on your choices.
- **Equity & Pot Odds Training:** Learn to compare your hand equity to pot odds and make the correct GTO call or fold.
- **Detailed Statistics:** Track your performance over time, broken down by street and player count. Identify strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Customizable Training:** Select which streets and player counts to practice, and adjust difficulty to match your skill level.
- **Explanations:** Receive clear, math-based explanations for each decision, including equity, pot odds, and why a call or fold is correct.
- **Progress Tracking:** View your accuracy, streaks, and recent results to monitor your improvement.

## How It Works

1. **Configure Training:** Choose the streets (preflop, flop, turn, river), number of players, and difficulty.
2. **Analyze the Scenario:** Review your hole cards, community cards, pot size, and the amount to call.
3. **Make Your Decision:** Decide to call or fold based on your estimated equity versus the pot odds.
4. **Get Feedback:** Instantly see if your decision was correct and read a detailed explanation.
5. **Track Progress:** Check your stats to see how your GTO decision-making improves over time.

## What is GTO Poker?

Game Theory Optimal (GTO) poker is a strategy that aims to make decisions that cannot be exploited by opponents. A key GTO concept is making calls when your equity exceeds the pot odds. PokerChecker helps you practice and internalize this principle.

## Disclaimer

PokerChecker uses simplified equity calculations for educational purposes. Real poker equity is more complex and depends on many factors. This tool is intended for training and learning, not for precise real-money play.
